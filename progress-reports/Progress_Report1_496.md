| Preston and Dalton | 2/5 | 1 hr 30 mins | Did some initial research to determine the best way to handle sharding. | Have a good starting point about how to approach the Rust backend. |
| Dalton | 2/11 | 1 hr 30 mins | Set up main.rs and got more familiar with how Rust works, along with the syntax. | Gained practice with Rust and am able to read in command line args. |
