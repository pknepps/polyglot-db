| Kevin & Dalton | 3/19 |  2 hours   | Spent time explaining the backend changes to Dalton (just came off front end) and performed research into sharding the system. Not enough time this sprint to begin implementing anything else into sharding. | Dalton is aware of the changes and have explored other options for sharding, such as CockroachDB.                                                                       |
|     Kevin      | 3/19 |  2 hours   | Implemented mongodb visualization feature on the frontend.                                                                                                                                                    | Clicking on the mongoDB button brings a json visualizaiton of the schema. Changes JSON rendered depending on whether a specific product is selected                     |
|     Dalton     | 3/20 |  3 hours   | Worked to implement the postgres vizualization feature, involved modifying the query performed on the backend and presenting the result in a elegant way on the frontend.                                     | Now when the postgres button is pressed on the right side component on the frontend, a graphical representation is shown for either a specific product or all products. |
