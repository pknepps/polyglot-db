| Preston | 4/9  | 2 hrs | Added rating/review creation page on frontent | Should now be able to create all data graphically |
| Preston | 4/9  | 1 hr | Fixed bug when creating new transactions ||
| Preston | 4/10  | 4 hrs | Added buttons to product page to create review and transaction which carries over current product and user id's when making new data | Purchasing and reviewing products now feels more natural |
| Preston | 4/27  | 1 hrs | set up backend on server | fully deployed backend is complete |
| Preston | 4/28  | 4 hrs | Got sharding to work | The sharding algorithm is complete |
| Preston | 5/1  | 2 hrs | Fixed bug with cache, as it did not implement the sharding algorithm | The cache is complete.|
| Dalton | 4/8 | 2 hrs | Able to generate random data from the frontend with the click of a button. | Users can now easily add data via the frontend. |
| Dalton | 4/14 | 1 hr 30 min | Added safety checks when creating users and transactions, reset search bar when clicking off. | The front end no longer causes backend to crash when names are over 50 letters or the state is over length 2. |
| Dalton | 4/23 | 5 hr | Began working on unit testing, which was one of the last things on the should have. | Used Jest, was able to get a few of the files tested (cache, recommendation, shard) and started several others. |
| Dalton | 4/24 | 1 hr | Finished up some unit tests and began working on get. | Finished about half of the files unit tests. |
| Dalton | 5/1 | 4 hr | Continued to work on unit tests, mainly in get. | There is not complete coverage on the project, but it is a good start to unit testing if another team decides to pick it up in the future. |
